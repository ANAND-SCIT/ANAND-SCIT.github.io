It is a great pleasure for me to extend a welcome to all of you who are participating in ICRDET-2022, the 3rd International Conference on Recent Development in Engineering \& Technology, which is being held in Anand International College of Engineering, Jaipur, India. The conference is jointly organized by Anand-ICE, Jaipur, India, and RTU, Kota, India.

Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, many participants could not meet face to face that’s why we decided to make it hybrid by use of technology. In this conference, we bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to exchange their research ideas and results and to discuss the state of the art in the areas of the conference together in a wonderful city of the world, Jaipur.

 There have been quite a big number of applications from different parts of the world and as you know when the number increase task of the organizing committee will increase. Thus it was a very difficult task to select and classify the abstracts for all the participants. We tried to do our best to accommodate many speakers in order to have better and more enjoyable research sessions that will provide more interactions, exchanges among the participants. The talks by eminent speakers and participants will cover a wide range of areas related to the theme of the conference.  We believe that this richness will provide the basis for interdisciplinary collaborations. 
 
 We are also very thankful to all the publishers' to open the special issues for the conference. We also would very much thank all presenters and participants for their interests in the ICRDET 2022 and believe and hope that each of them will get the maximum benefit in terms of networking and interaction from this meeting.

The talk presents a soft computing identification method of the operating
regimes for controllers based on the qualitative analyze of the phase trajectory of
the error. The control of highly non-linear and time variable systems demands high
quality self-adaptation. Even we dispose of valid mathematical models for the
controlled plants, the adaptation strategy is inspired by the classic methods from
linear control, like the operational calculus. In most of the real applications we
don’t have valid knowledge about the controlled plant and its mathematical model,
their physical parameters are varying in time and unpredictable external
perturbations may occur. In such cases, the only possible approach that can be
always used is the heuristic one. We propose the phase trajectory of the error as the
basic tool able to support the on-line heuristic adaptive action. The judgments
standing behind the proposed method will be answers to the basic question: “how
would a human operator control and adapt an unknown plant?”.

Considering the size dependent utilization complexities of nanoscopic dimensions towards real applications, the focus of nanomaterials community is merging to three-dimensional (3D) form of materials which are built out interconnected nanostructures. This talk will briefly introduce the importance of complex shaped nanostructures towards smart 3D nanomaterials structuring. A simple flame based single step approach was developed for synthesizing zinc oxide tetrapods which demonstrated many applications in different technologies. These tetrapods have been used as building blocks to construct highly porous interconnected 3D nanonetworks in form of flexible ceramics which offer further new application avenues. Additionally, these 3D networks have been utilized as sacrificial templates to develop hollow tetrapodal 3D networks from almost any desired material, carbons, nitrides, oxides, polymers, hydrogels, etc. The sacrificial template-based strategy offers new and unique opportunities in the direction of 3D nanomaterials engineering and accordingly advanced technological applications. Some examples of 3D nanomaterials engineering will be demonstrated alongwith their applications [1-10]. The scopes of 3D nanostructuring based smart materials in sensing, electronics, optoelectronics, energy, and biomedical engineering will be briefly highlighted in the talk.

Abstract
The aim of this study is to discuss application of the CESTAC method and the CADNA library to control the accuracy of the Adomian decomposition method and the homotopy perturbation method to solve the linear and nonlinear Volterra integral equations with discontinuous kernel. The importance of solving this problem is be- cause of its applications in the load leveling problems, energy storage with renewable and diesel generation, charge/discharge storages control and others.
In general, the mathematical methods for solving the mentioned problem are based on floating point arithmetic and the accuracy of the method has been discussed using the traditional absolute error which depends on the exact solution and also a positive small value$\epsilon$. But in real life problems we do not have the exact solution. Also, based on this condition we will not be able to find more accurate approximations because we do not have information about optimal $\epsilon$. For small values of $\epsilon$, the numerical algorithm can not be stopped and extra iterations will be produced without improving the accuracy. For large values of $\epsilon$, the numerical algorithm will be stopped in initial steps without producing enough iterations.
Because of the mentioned problems we apply a new termination criterion which depends on two successive approximations. For this aim we apply the CESTAC method and the CADNA library which are based on stochastic arithmetic. In this condition, not only we do not need to have the exact solution but also we would be able to identify the optimal approximation, optimal iteration and optimal error of numerical procedure. Also, the CADNA library is applied as an important software for this validation. The CADNA library should be done on the LINUX operating system and its codes should be written using C, C++ or ADA codes.

Thin films are used in many structures like high-performance RF devices, microwave ICs, solar cells, and many electronic instruments like lasers, diodes, bipolar transistors. The epitaxial growth technique produces these thin films under high vacuum conditions from the crystal in the semiconductor industry. This talk focuses on a fourth-order nonlinear singular boundary value problem that models Epitaxial growth. The existence of solutions will be discussed. We also discuss how depending on a parameter, existence can fail.

The paper deals with the research and discussions concerning the active employing the digital instruments and programs in the near-future studies of the Indian intellectual tradition. The term “Digital Indology”, we use here this term by analogue with the term “Digital Humanities”, in the field of the philosophy means investigation of the philosophical textual tradition of Ancient and Medieval India with the using of the digital technology, mathematic statistics, contextual analysis methods and the traditional approaches of the Humanities. The main trends of elaborating the Digital Philosophical Indology (creating the Open Data of Indian Philosophy, elaborating the special programs for ‘reading’ the various Indian shrifts, application of the new methods of analysis of the philosophical texts with the use of digital technologies) are expounded. As the basic methods of analysis of the philosophical texts of India we consider the method of mathematical statistics and the method of contextual analysis. The hidden dangers of using the digital technologies for academical sphere of studies in general and for the intellectual tradition of India in particularly are taken into consideration: sociological intervention, mathematization of the results, minimization of the role of the philosophizing interpretation. The conclusion of such a brief manifest of the Digital Philosophical Indology is declaration of it only as an instrument for the classical Indological studies, which has its own philosophical tasks and aims.

We present a formulation of quantum mechanics based on the theory of orthogonal polynomials. The wave function is expanded over a complete set of square integrable basis where the expansion coefficients are orthogonal polynomials in the energy and physical parameters. Information about the corresponding physical systems (both structural and dynamical) are derived from the properties of these polynomials. We demonstrate that an advantage of this formulation is that the class of exactly solvable quantum mechanical problems becomes larger than in the conventional formulation. We limit our investigation in this work to the Askey classification scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and focus on the Wilson polynomial and two of its limiting cases (the Meixner-Pollaczek and continuous dual Hahn polynomials). Nonetheless, the formulation is amenable to other classes of orthogonal polynomials.

Traffic congestion is a thorny issue to many large and medium-sized cities, posing a serious threat to sustainable urban development. Recently, intelligent traffic system (ITS) has emerged as an effective tool to mitigate urban congestion. The key to the ITS lies in the accurate forecast of traffic flow. However, the existing forecast methods of traffic flow cannot adapt to the stochasticity and sheer length of traffic flow time series. To solve the problem, this paper relies on deep learning (DL) to forecast traffic flow through time series analysis. The authors developed a traffic flow forecast model based on the bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM-RNNs) with delay. The proposed model was compared with two classic forecast models, namely, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNNS) model, through long-term traffic flow forecast experiments, using an actual traffic flow time series from OpenITS. The experimental results show that the proposed BLSTM-RNNs network outperformed the classic models in prediction accuracy. Our research discloses the dynamic evolution law of traffic flow and facilitates the decision-making of traffic management.

In various domains of science and engineering, such as computer vision,
molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern recognition, and data mining, graphs
may be used to show many underlying relationships among data. Graph Neural
Networks (GNN) not only gathers individual information, but also uses data from other
samples to create a graph. Graph neural networks are a type of information processing
system that operates by sending messages between graph nodes. GNN variations such
as the graph attention network (GAT), graph convolutional network (GCN), and graph
recurrent network (GRN) have showed revolutionary performance in deep learning and
artificial intelligence applications in recent years. Based on the problems it addresses,
GNN may be classified into three categories: link prediction, node classification, and
graph classification. The proposal is on design of a new Pearson Correlation based
Graph Neural Network (PC-GNN) and to categorize human lower limb activity
recognition.

The development of Earth-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) models to reduce building energy use has been notable for the last several decades.However, selecting and executing the most effective EAHE modelling technique in buildings is still a difficulty due to climate, performance, and modelling technique limitations.This paper discusses the available research on several EAHE modelling techniques, including physical, data-driven and hybrid approaches for building applications.Unmeasured disturbances, assumptions, or uncertainties induced in experimental and numerical research of all EAHE modelling methodologies are also discussed.It is demonstrated that hybrid modelling outperforms data-driven and physical models for accurate prediction.However, if EAHE operational circumstances and all essential parameters are included during model building, hybrid models suffer from high complexity.In terms of generality, physical models outperform hybrid and some data-driven models.In addition, a small number of training data is required for physical models, while medium and high numbers are required for hybrid and data-driven models.

$-\triangle u + c(·, u) = 0$ in $\Omega $ with nonlinearity $c(x, u) := \int_{\partial \Omega}b(x, y, u) dS(y)$\\\\
subject to nonlocal integral Neumann boundary conditions [1]\\
\\
$\frac{\partial d}{\partial \vec{n}} = Iu$ on $\partial \Omega$ with $\int_{\partial \Omega}b(x, y, u(x)) dx$\\\\
modelling non-local interactions between interior points and boundary points. In the
case where the state-dependent kernel $b : \Omega  \times \partial \Omega\times  R \longrightarrow R $ is singular, i.e. where
$b(x, y, u)$ blows up for $\Omega \ni  x \rightarrow y \in \partial \Omega$ so fast that $b(x, y, u) \notin L^{1}(\Omega  \times \partial \Omega)$ for fixed $u \in R$, we prove uniqueness of solutions by invoking duality to linear elliptic PDEs
with fractional divergence as lower order term [2]. In the second part, we consider in
contrast to local finite element methods for the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs
the spectral Bernstein dual Petrov-Galerkin method on a cube $\Omega$ [3]. To use Bernstein
polynomials as non-localized basis functions has some advantages, and we particularly
aim to discuss positivity of solutions for non-negative non-zero data [4].

With the growing demand of electricity worldwide, most of the power generation companies focus on long-term and cost-effective asset operation and maintenance strategies to reduce their unplanned downtime which is their main cost driver. Power generating companies are trying to make their commercial process smart and agile enough to do proactive equipment assessment and failure identification in advance rather than taking corrective actions after an event. A turbine failure occurs when a turbine unexpectedly stops producing power due to malfunctioning or break-down of the key components. This creates a complete shutdown of the power generation process and disruption in power generation.
To keep these operational, it is extremely important to have a robust asset reliability and failure prediction models which can pro-actively help these companies to manage their operation and maintenance costs optimally. In this paper, we have studied the failure pattern of turbines after fitting most commonly used single distribution (such as Weibull, gamma and log-normal) and also composite and mixed distributions by the help of machine learning tools to forecast asset failure patterns more accurately. The paper finally compares between single distribution model fitting with composite and mixed distribution model fitting. The numerical illustration is based on historical failure data of 2470 turbines.
More importantly, if more than one suitable model exists, the same can be mathematically combined to get a joint forecast model to forecast failure pattern which is found better than single distribution applied separately. Finally, these predictive methods could be applied to a power generating company for the failure forecast of its assets and to identify upcoming commercial action in advance.

Analytical and numerical methods for solving the one-dimensional Rieszspace fractional
Schr\"{o}dinger equation are presented in thecase of a particle moving in a potential field. The
fractional derivative is defined by the quantum Riesz fractional derivative. In this respect, a
nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the Riesz fractional derivative has been considered. This
equation has been solved by two reliable methods in order to investigate the accuracy of the
solutions. In the implicit finite difference numerical scheme, the fractional centered difference is
utilized to approximate the Riesz fractional derivative. Also a novel modified optimal homotopy
asymptotic method with Fourier transform (MOHAM-FT) has been proposed to compute the
approximate solution of Riesz fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Further the numerical
solutions obtained by proposed implicit finite difference method, have been compared with that
obtained by MOHAM-FT to exhibit the effectiveness of the suggested methods. Finally, the
obtained solutions have been presented graphically to justify the efficiency of the methods.

Non-triangular metric spaces have been introduced by Khojasteh and Khandani ([13]) in 2020. The concept of non-triangular metric spaces is fresh and therefore, requires quite some analysis on its topology. In this talk, we shall discuss about the topology of non-triangular metric spaces by giving a natural definition of open sets in this context. The introduction of non-triangular metric spaces has shown that there is no inherent need for the triangle inequality to prove various fixed point results. Keeping this in mind, we give a fixed point result for Suzuki type Z-contractions in the context of non-triangular metric spaces by introducing a new property of maps. We also see the scope of further work on this topic.

An analysis is made for the generalized transient convective flows over an infinite, vertical, heated circular cylinder. The generalization considers a new form of the constitutive equation of the thermal flux based on the generalized time-fractional derivative with Mittag-Leffler kernel, called the generalized Atangana-Baleanu derivative.Closed forms of the analytical solutions for the temperature and velocity fields, expressed with Bessel and Struve functions, are determined using the Laplace transform and the Weber-Dirichlet transform.The solutions obtained for the generalized case are suitable for particularizations to give solutions corresponding to fractional derivatives with power-law kernel and exponential kernel. The ordinary case corresponding to classical Fourier's law is also obtained.Numerical simulations obtained with the software Mathcad are carried out and graphically illustrated in order to compare models based on generalized Atangana-Baleanu, Atangana-Baleanu, Caputo, and Caputo-Fabrizio time-fractional derivatives.

This article explains the reason why we interpret the structure of a machine brain as a five-layer intelligence. First, we review the physiological structure of the human brain. About 80\% of a human brain are water, and the others are complex biochemical structures. It is almost impossible to simulate the physiological structure of the human brain. Second, we analyze the functional mechanisms of the human brain, including a preliminary understanding of the connections between neurons in the brain. The role of synapses is also discussed. It is possible to simulate the learning mechanisms of a human brain. Finally, we present a framework to carry out such simulation by summarizing the current level of machine intelligence as a “five-layer intelligence”. Explicit functional mechanisms and practical examples of the five intelligence layers, along with trends in machine intelligence and the role of nonlinear science, are also further interpreted.

Cancer is a spontaneous, organic change marked by genetic alterations that lead to tumor growth, clinical progression, immune evasion, and the evolution of chemoresistance. Mathematical models of tumor growth have been reviewed in this paper. Mathematical equations were constructed using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), and discrete modeling features to model the tumor cell's growth rate. The stochastic Gompertz model is better suited for evaluating experimental results than the stochastic logistic model. Also PDEs estimate the long-term change in the total tumor cell population and the discrete models analyze actions at the scale of individual cells over continuum models. A summary of the major study problems is given, and a rationale is provided for the conclusion.

Cloud computing is a burgeoning breakthrough in
the IT business right now. By providing its services, cloud
computing allows the IT industry to drastically reduce its infrastructure
costs. Virtualization is one of their primary services
via which cloud computing achieves its goals, and live migration
in virtual machines provides numerous benefits such as fault tolerance,
management, and increased productivity by minimising
machine downtime. A key element of virtualization systems is
live migration, which allows a running Virtual Machine (VM)
from one physical host to be moved to another without causing
any service interruptions. Higher availability, load management,
energy conservation, and disaster recovery are undeniably the
benefits acquired from VM migration, which are their ideal
information centre qualities. During the VM migration process,
data from the CPU, RAM, and storage is moved, and we
determine the type of data that has to be transmitted in each
situation. We provide a quick overview of security concerns
in live VM migration and classify them into three groups
(control plane, data plane, and migration module). We also go
through the security needs and available options for preventing
assaults.
\newpage
Specific flaws are noted, as well as the research hurdles
involved in enhancing the performance of live VM migration. The
importance of this study is that it provides a background on live
VM migration strategies as well as an in-depth evaluation that
will enable cloud professionals and researchers better understand
the issues and propose appropriate solutions.

Along with the pandemic process that has been effective all over the world, the duration of indoor environment use has increased significantly. In parallel, the spread of viruses in the environment and the transmission of them to humans began to emerge as a serious problem. In this study, analyses and evaluations were made about air quality and the need for ventilation depending on the CO2 level for indoor spaces. In this context, long-term CO2 measurements were made in different indoor areas. The obtained data were used to analyze the state of virus spread in closed spaces and, accordingly, to determine the need for ventilation. It has been revealed by the study that the natural ventilation applied in closed spaces that cannot have a ventilation system does not work very much and that there is a serious need for ventilation both in terms of health and cleanliness.

Gravel is a naturally occurring granular deposit that is used as coarse aggregate in concrete production. It is perceived by many as not being as strong as granite and as such its use is limited.  However, with the high cost of granite and the fact that it is readily available in some parts of South Western Nigeria where granite is scarce and the cost of transportation additionally prohibitive, the use of gravel becomes inevitable. This study examines the physical and mechanical properties of gravel with the aim of determining its suitability for concrete production. In the study, laboratory tests were carried out to determine the gradation, specific gravity, water absorption, moisture content, aggregate impact, abrasion, and crushing values. Results of the tests indicate that the gradation of almost all the samples is poor. Furthermore, the range of values of specific gravity, water absorption, moisture content, aggregate impact, abrasion, and crushing values are 2.71 – 2.9, 0.52 – 8.26,0.65.1.96, 28.6 – 51.3, 23.33 -52.92, and 5.2 – 24.8 respectively. From the results obtained, apart from the gradation of the aggregates that exceeds the limit in the lower sieve sizes, most of the samples are suitable for use as coarse aggregates in concrete production for most of the other physical and coarse aggregates.

In everyday life, humans make numerous deci-sions on various fronts. Frequently, these decisions are made based on several factors, some of which are explicit, whereas some of them are vague and not precise. These lead to certain challenges while making decisions, to deal with which, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques have been devel-oped. The goal of this article is to provide a means to rank and hence select a university for admission for students, using Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solu-tion (FTOPSIS) method. A novel distance measure has been proposed, for the same. Some axiomatic properties have also been proved. To aid in the process of university selection, the suggested work enables ranking of universities based on certain criteria in fuzzy environment. The results suggest that the pro-posed model provides a realistic way to select the best university among the pool of considered universities. The paper concludes with a discussion of a case study and experimental results.

During the past few years, the whole country is very much worried about the greenhouse gasses releases that are warming the earth. In response to this, a single-period multi-objective inventory problem is formulated under uncertainty for perishable goods. The aim is to maximize the expected profit as well as minimize the total carbon emission. Due to increasing difficulty and challenging issues newsboy problem under uncertain environment, we assumed the demand for the product is random-fuzzy variables.
\newpage
 Credibility theory is used to formulate the crisp equivalent form of the random-fuzzy variable. Since the developed model of the problem is NP-hard, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is proposed to solve the problem. Besides, since no benchmark is available in the literature to verify and validate the results obtained, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is suggested to solve the problem. Then, the performances of the two algorithms are compared in terms of some multi-objective performance measures and showed that the MOPSO is better choice for solving our proposed model. Finally, we have perform a sensitivity by changing the uncertainty parameter which will help the decision maker to put his order depending on his/her demand.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is widely used to produce intrinsic 3D structures with high accuracy. The use of additive manufacturing technique has increased significantly in tissue engineering (TE) over the years. TE is used to repair and regenerate impaired tissues caused by trauma, disease, and injury by fabricating scaffolds. Various materials like polymers, ceramics, and composites provide immense potential for producing scaffolds. The major challenge in manufacturing these bioactive and patient-specific scaffolds has been to control the architecture and the pore size for cell proliferation and adhesion. The traditional techniques are not efficient enough for meeting the requirements of the scaffolds. The AM technology can produce the desired pore distribution and the pore size. Hence, the AM technology is being employed for the development and fabrication of TE scaffolds. This review focuses on various methods used for printing scaffolds like stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and binder jetting (BJ). This work also reviews various materials used for the fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering. It discusses the advantages of those materials, and various applications of those materials for TE scaffolds. This work also deals with the effect of scaffold geometry on various scaffold properties like mechanical properties, porosity and proliferation.

COVID-19, a coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in December 2019. The first incidence of COVID-19 was reported in India on January 30. The Government has initiated various government interventions to stop the spread of COVID-19. Several researchers have implemented compartmental models to identify and analyze the effect of different government measures such as lockdown, social distancing, wearing masks, home isolation, etc. In this research, we present a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model to assess the impact of various government initiatives to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Rajasthan's several districts. We have analyzed the data from April 26, 2020, to October 31, 2021. We have estimated the reproductive number for all the districts. The analysis attained through the predicted results shows that the modified SIRD model effectively identifies the transmission and mortality rate of COVID-19 in India in the 33 districts of Rajasthan.

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETS) have gained much attention due to their dynamic nature and efficiency .These networks are operated in highly dynamic and unpredictable  environment . Rapid advances in the field of correspondence have vastly enhanced today's transmission networks .As a result, the measurement of data transmission in business and military applications has grown dramatically. Since these applications include the transmission of information, the need for security concerns has grown as well. Due to their dynamic nature they are susceptible to various attacks.
\newpage
The lack of a centralized authority to supervise the individual nodes operating in the network makes security in the mobile adhoc network a major challenge. Attacks can originate both within and outside the network. In this paper we will present a survey of various attacks in MANETs and their prevention and mitigation techniques given by researchers .

In Neural Network-based Learning techniques, there are several models of Convolutional
Networks. Whenever the methods are deployed with large datasets only then could their applicability
and appropriateness be determined. Clinical and pathological pictures of lobular carcinoma are thought
to exhibit a large number of random formations and textures. Working with so pictures is a difficult
problem in machine learning. Focusing on wet laboratories and following the outcomes, numerous studies
have been published with fresh commentaries in the investigation. In this research, we provide a
framework that can operate effectively on raw photos of various resolutions while easing the issues
caused by the existence of patterns and texturing. The suggested approach produces very good findings
that may be used to make decisions in the diagnosis of cancer.

The prime object of the current research paper is to analyse the influence of the pile diameter, length and relative density of
the granular material of the pile on pull-out resisting capacity of the modified form of conventional concrete pile commonly called as
Granular Pile Anchor (GPA) installed in loose cohesion less soil. The single GPA with different length to diameter ratios varying as 10,
6.67, 5 for the length of 300 mm of the pile, 13.33, 8.89, 6.67 for 400 mm length of GPA and 16.67, 11.11, 8.83 for 500 mm length of GPA
were examined using PLAXIS 3D. The GPA reinforced soil was analyzed in terms of its pull-out resisting capacity by altering the
physical parameters of the pile. The subsoil condition was assumed to be dry and homogeneous throughout. As per the numerical study,
it was revealed that all of the factors such as diameter, length and relative density of the pile played an important role in significantly
improving the performance of the GPA against pull-out forces. It was also observed that for the constant length, the capacity decreased
with an upsurge in the value of aspect ratio of GPA.

Vaccination is seen as a weapon that not only profits an individual
to ght the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus but also helps in building herd immunity
for the general public. There are a lot of individuals who are keen and willing
to get inoculated by the Covid-19 vaccine and return back to their normal
life. However, there is some public who still are unwilling for the vaccination
due to vaccine hesitancy. And even after vaccination(one dose), there may
be cases of breakthrough infections with mild symptoms. Unwillingness for
vaccination and breakthrough infections are now very important aspects of this
ongoing epidemic amid the vaccination process that needs to be challenged by
responsible stakeholders.
\newpage
 Thus, we will first formulate an ordinary diferential
equation (ODE) model consisting of willing and unwilling (for vaccination)
population along with breakthrough infection.We will then extend ODE model
to a queueing model that accounts for the movement of willing and non-willing
susceptible individuals as well. The governing equations are formed and the
transition rates from one stage to another are taken to follow an exponential
distribution. The transient state probabilities of the model are acquired by
applying the matrix method and thereafter Runge-Kutta 4th order method is
employed to attain various performance indices. The parameters are estimated
for our system based on the standard nonlinear least-squares method using the
real data of the vaccinated (one dose) population for India between the time
period of 5 March 2021 to 3 July 2021. We would first aim to study the impact
of this system on the basic reproduction number ${\rho}^0$. The sensitivity analysis
of  ${\rho}^0$ is done to recognize the important estimated parameters which may
help in controlling the epidemic. Then the impact of the unwillingness and
breakthrough infections directly helping in transmission of the infection amid
the vaccination process is shown by uncertainty analysis using the technique of PRCC and contour plots. Numerical analysis is also provided to certify the
queueing model.

 This study evaluates the efficiency of a batch arrival discrete-time queueing model with retrials and dissimilar two kinds of vacations, one being a non-comprehensive high-priority (emergency) vacation during operation while the other is a regular comprehensive vacation. In a typical comprehensive vacation, the service provider instantly takes a vacation as easily as possible the orbit is unoccupied whereas if the server goes on a non-comprehensive high-priority (emergency) vacation, the client being served joins the virtual lap and the customer that’s interrupted must receive service from the scratch. In the proposed model we firstly obtain the generating functions for the customer’s number. Then, by using technique of generating function, we give the steady-state analysis. Also, we have derived various useful performance indices such as probabilities when the service provider is idle, busy, on normal vacation and on high-priority (emergency) vacation.

This paper discusses the principle, design and theoretical dynamical modelling of mems capacitive pressure sensors with varied material properties that have been simulated as well a comparison of results has been presented. The properties of material ensure that sensor performances analysis has been analysed 0-15 kPa for operating pressure range. This work also discusses Timoshenko’s plate deflection theory and follow the pull-in phenomenon, finally for measuring the accurate sensitivity numerical solution is also presented. The behaviour of the touch mode capacitive pressure sensor in terms of the temperature dependence of capacitance is analyzed and also observed the repeatability error is reduced. this comparison of results shows that aluminium material gives the highest deflection and better capacitance sensitivities are about 35aF/0.1bar and deflection is linear with the applied pressure. This configuration touch mode pressure sensor is promising for the use of health monitoring devices like patient blood pressure.

Illegal mining of river sand had an adverse effect on the eco-system. The land slides ,continuous
floods, tectonic movements had destroyed the peace of common man. The aim of this research is to study
the aspects of fine aggregates and replacing the same in concrete by various agricultural wastes. In this
study, corncob ash, groundnut shell and sugarcane bagasse ash are used as the replacing fillers. The
properties of these agro wastes are at various replacement levels of 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\% and 20\% with
fine aggregates are analyzed. The study reveals the various fresh concrete tests such as slump test,
shrinkage test and density test . In the hardened state of agro – waste concrete, various tests such as
compressive strength, flexural strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity tests were analyzed at the age of 7 days,
28 days, 56 days and 90 days. The utilization of agro – wastes proves to be very sustainable and eco –
friendly in construction but the limitation is its replacement level.

In India maximum structure is made up of reinforced concrete as camper to Steel Structure. After construction of reinforced concrete structures are subjected to repairs and damages to with respect time and age of the structure. So, to keep the reinforced structure in a good and healthy condition we need some repair and rehabilitation, and retrofitting methods to minimize the losses and avoid large damages in the reinforced concrete structures. By using these methods, we can minimize the losses and avoid sudden failures of the reinforced concrete structures. Nowadays the use of rehabilitation and retrofitting methods are increases. In this most failures of reinforced structures are minimized. The major and minor losses of reinforced concrete structures are identified and later minimized. This paper mainly focuses on various types of repairs of reinforced concrete structures and the importance of using rehabilitation and retrofitting methods in reinforced concrete structures. The main aim of the study is to identify the repairs and damages in the reinforced cement concrete structures and solve the repairs by using suitable methods to decrease the damages. This is placing an important role in the early detection of damages and decrease the severity and losses of the damage in the reinforced cement concrete structures.

This work is based on development of Predictive Model for Metal Matrix Composite using Artificial Neural Network for prediction of hardness value of the developed Al 6063 composite reinforced with silicon carbide by using stir casting machine. ANNs are numerical coding that imitates the working style of human brain. For prediction of the data the training of the network is done by using two sets of data called the training data and test data by using feed forward back propagation technique. The Design of experiments was done using Taguchi L 16 orthogonal arrays and 70\% of the data was used as training data and 30\% of the data was used as test data for checking the developed network. Reinforcement \%, Stirring speed and stirring time were taken as the process parameters .The whole work is divided into two parts, in the first part the composite were obtained using L 27 orthogonal arrays and the hardness values of the sample were recorded .In the second part the training of the Artificial Neural Network was done using the training data and finally the network was tested using test data .The Predicted value of the the network was compared with the experimental data. After comparing the results it can be said that a well trained ANN Model is an efficient tool in predicting the hardness value of the developed composite.

To derive an analytical solution of shrinkage stresses in a simplified Class-I composite restoration
using a viscoelastic material model. Methods. Simplified, multi-layer, circular plane models were
used to represent different sections of a tooth with a Class-I restoration: one section is close to the
top occlusal surface and the other is at a deeper location of the restoration. The sections are
therefore subjected to different stress states, i.e., plane-stress and plane-strain, respectively. The
analytical solution got was compared with the numerical results from finite element analysis. A
sensitivity study was then carried out to examine the relative influence of geometric and material
parameters on shrinkage stress development. A viscoelastic solution for the shrinkage stresses
developed in a simplified Class-I restoration during polymerization has been derived. The solution
allows the influence of several geometric and material parameters on shrinkage stress development
to be examined readily. It also provides a benchmark test for more elaborate numerical schemes
before they are used to analyzing more complicated cases.

This paper presents the comparison of the influence of additives Zn and Ag on the thermodynamics properties of Se80-xTe20Mx (M=Ag, Zn), $(0\leq x\leq10)$ glasses using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) under non-isothermal condition at different heating rates. Different theoretical models have been employed to study the activation energy of glass transition (Et) and crystallization (EC), Entropy, Enthalpy and Gibbs free energy for the best understanding of thermal stability. These parameters are found to be highly composition dependent. This also indicates that the glass network of the binary alloy is influenced significantly due to addition of the modifiers (Ag, Zn) used in the present study. Furthermore, investigated outcomes illustrate that the incorporation of fixed amount of Te with increasing Ag and Zn concentration affects the kinetic energies and glass forming abilities of the as formed glasses. However, when Zn compared with Ag glasses, it is found that they show almost the same kinetic parameters.

It’s very common about the importance and necessity of concrete in construction industries. However, a known fact, a lot of energy is utilized for the preparation of concrete which in turn imbalances the environment by creating various health hazards. The concept of Green concrete is gaining popularity compared to normal concrete. Nowadays it plays a very good role in the construction of structures. It is subjected to very low energy consumption and low resource consumption. This paper mainly deals with the study of importance of Environmental friendly concrete and its applications and advantages and disadvantages as well.

Recently, a novel nitrogenated holey two-dimensional material, C2N, has been successfully synthesized via a simple wet-chemical reaction. Its merits have drawn much attention from the scientists.
\vskip 2mm
\newpage
 However, to the best of our knowledge, few reported works employed C2N as photovoltaic materials and the practical solar cells based on C2N have not been fabricated in lab. In this work, we carried out simulation using Scaps-1D to investigate the influences of different parameters on the C2N based solar cell. By varying the acceptor density, layer thickness, defect density of C2N and changing different N layers coupling with C2N, we found out that suitable acceptor density, around 1015cm−3, large layer thickness of C2N and low defect density were key factors to obtain high-performance solar cells. Small band offset also played an importance role in enhancing the performance of photovoltaic materials. With optimized parameters, C2N coupling with CdS as heterojunction can achieve an efficiency of over 17\%. This work may provide valuable insights into future design of C2N based solar cells.

Concrete-filled tubes provide unnecessary closure. In recent years, more studies have been reported of the members' double-skin lesions. However, most of them had metal tubes. The study reported in this paper presents the experimental work on a double-skin (DSTC) column with UPVC tubes - both as inner and outer skin. The DSTC models with an H / D dimension of 3 and the outer diameter of 90 mm and 75 mm are made of 30 mm UPVC tube as the inner diameter of each tube as 3 mm. Two types of DSTC models were studied, one with a blank internal core and the other with a solid spine. Examples of single-skin tubes have been developed to compare the behavior of single and double skin. The matrix was considered a self-compact concrete (SCC), as it contains a large amount of fly ash, so the compressive strength of the matrix and the tubular specimens over 28 days were also investigated. Comparison of test results with EUROCODE 4, ACI, Australian code, and energy absorption tests and confinement parameters is presented.

Nowadays laser diodes, LED’s, optical wave guides, directional couplers and photo detectors are widely used in telecommunication, for biomedical applications, pollution monitoring tools etc. Lasers can be designed by using various semiconductor materials by changing their composition. In our work we have designed a nano scale hetero structure using semiconductor compounds GaInP/AlGaInP for generating a wavelength of 635nm having optical gain of order ~4000/cm at carrier injection of 5*1012/cm2 at room temperature. The calculation of wave functions, dipole moments and optical gain are done by using Luttinger Kohn 4*4 model. The optical gain computed for Ga0.46In0.54P/Al0.25Ga0.27In0.48P type-I quantum well hetero structure (varying well width 3nm-7nm) is further analyzed for external strain applied and at different temperatures in order to make the laser more suitable to be used for different purposes. The effect of uniaxial strain [001] applied shows significant improvement in optical gain under z polarization whereas x and y polarizations are less effected by applied strain. The designed hetero structure is analyzed under different temperature conditions for below and above room temperature. The reported results show that the designed laser can be used for a range of 600-650nm wavelength.

Audio Steganography is an approach to inserting visible or invisible marks into a digital multimedia data for further detection of rightful ownership at the later stages. Mostly, Steganography schemes focus on text and image steganography, and a few are related with audio. This report concentrates on improving the performance of spread spectrum audio steganography technique. Audio Steganography is the process of embedding a encrypted digital signal into an audio signal for proof of rightful ownership. This process is rather difficult due to the high sensitivity of the Human Auditory System (HAS). Among all the steganography techniques, audio and video steganography is very efficient for secret message transmission. In this work, we used text based steganography with audio steganography, which is done through the spread spectrum watermarking technique. In text steganography, message can be hidden by shifting word and line in open spaces or in word sequence. The advantage of preferring text steganography over other steganography techniques is its smaller memory requirement and simpler communication. Proposed text based steganography uses characteristics of English language such as inflexion, fixed word order and use of periphrases for hiding data rather than using properties of a sentence as in. This gives flexibility and freedom from the point view of sentence construction but it increases computational complexity.

Since then, both the traffic pattern and technology have evolved. The number of tandem, tridem, and multi-axle vehicles has skyrocketed, and larger axle weights are becoming more frequent. Because pavements are built according to design standards and specifications, they may not serve efficiently, safely, or economically for the planned term due to early deterioration of materials with differing qualities.

The focus has switched from large-scale usage of conventional aggregates to use of local, recycled, and engineered marginal aggregates in construction due to environmental concerns and regulatory constraints on quarrying. Fatigue cracking and rutting deformation, induced by excessive horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of the bituminous layer and vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade, are well-known causes of asphalt pavement failure. This research aims to broaden the scope of pavement design by incorporating alternative materials such as cementitious and reclaimed asphalt, and analyzing them with the IITPAVE software. A road stretch surrounding Jaipur was chosen for this investigation, and the engineering features of subgrade soil were investigated. Cementitious Base and Cementitious Sub-base of aggregate interlayer for crack relief are examples of varied pavement composition materials. Cementitious base and sub-base with SAMI at the base-bituminous layer interface. RAP treated with a foamed bitumen/bitumen emulsion or new aggregates The traditional granular base and granular sub base have been designed, studied, and compared to cementitious sub-base. In comparison to standard granular base and granular sub-base, the employment of various composition materials in pavement structure enhances serviceability. Among all the composition the cemented base and sub base with SAMI gives better serviceability because of substantial reduction in strains, thickness and cost effective compared to other design. Hence it can be recommended for stretch selected for studies.

Nowadays with the advancement of technology, the demand for electrical power is increasing at
an exponential rate. Many consumer appliances demand consistent quality power for their operation. The
performance of the end-user equipment depends heavily on the quality of power supplied to it. But the quality
of power delivered to the end-user is affected by various external and internal factors such as voltage and
frequency variations, faults, outages, etc. These power quality problems reduce the lifespan and efficiency of
the equipment. Thus, these problems should be minimized to enhance the performance of the consumer
equipment and also to enhance the overall performance of the system. The main effect caused by these
problems is the production of harmonics. This results in the overheating of the equipment, insulation failure
and over speeding of induction motors, etc. The solution for eliminating these problems is to filter the
harmonics from the system. For this purpose, there are many filter topologies present within the paper. A
hybrid filter has been studied in this paper which is a combination of series active filter and shunt passive
filter. This paper presents the control strategy to regulate the filter in such a way that the harmonics are
reduced. The proposed control strategy is simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK and therefore the results are
presented.

This paper reviews the chronological advancement of electric vehicle and its applications. Here, only controlling features are specifically discussed by various authors. It critically appraises a number of state-of-the-art research progresses in this field developed within the last ten years. Finally, it points out the future potential research directions regarding electric vehicle technology and its applications, especially of charging techniques. By reading this review paper, readers will not only grasp a technical background of electric vehicle technology, but also gain a full picture of the research field. In the hybrid concept, the source of power is a combination of heat engine and batteries (in essence, the heat engine supplies steady state power and the batteries supply transient power demands). This paper contains limited results of a study aimed at determining the feasibility of using a hybrid heat engine/electric propulsion system as a means of reducing exhaust emissions from street-operated vehicles. It covers the electric motor/ generator and their control systems but excludes the heat engine, emissions and the battery portion of the study. Several classes of vehicles as well as several design configurations were considered in the study. Following a review of associated technologies, requirements for electrical components were determined. Based on these results recommendations were formulated to ensure early demonstration of prototype vehicles.

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard MAC protocol for WSNs is design mainly for static
sensor networks and its capability to support the networks of mobile sensor has not yet
been established. Integrating node mobility features in WSNs raises many new
challenges to the research association. In WSN, node mobility is expected to facilitate
many applications, from home healthcare and medical monitoring to detect the target
and monitoring animals. Mobility in WSN raises new challenges and problems that
occur at MAC layer due to the existing link failure and new link formation. To
overcome these limitation of mobile nodes we have proposed mobility adaptive (MA)-
CSMA/CA with adaptive BE for mobile WSNs in this paper. The proposed MAC is
energy efficient while maintaining high throughput and low latency compared to the
existing standard CSMA/CA MAC protocol of IEEE 802.15.4. The proposed work is
implemented on Qualnet 5.0.2 Network Simulator and the performance of CSMA/CA
and MA-CSMA/CA MAC protocol is evaluated for mobile WSNs.

The stability of power system is largely affected by faults on the transmission line and time required to clear the faults. Thus, the power system stability and power quality are dependent on the transmission line protection schemes. Quick detection of faults helps in faster maintenance and restoration of supply, resulting in improved stability, power quality and economy of power system. Various methodologies have been proposed in the literature for transmission lines protection. In this paper a review of proposed literature schemes has been done to identify the research gaps, which are still there to be overcome. For this, various kinds of transmission systems and the kinds of technique proposed have been taken into consideration. A brief comparison among proposed schemes has also been made to identify the significances of one technique over other.

Nanomaterials play a vital role in the applications
of Nanotechnology in the field of fabrication-such
as information technology, energy resources,
health and medical therapies. As our reliance upon
sustainable power source turns out to be clearer,
the requirement for proficient solar based cells
turns out to be more critical, particularly when
they are one of the most straightforward and least
expensive approaches to produce clean vitality. As
a rule, Solar cells are not excessively effective.
Ongoing advances in graphene - based sun
powered cells have seen the reflectance of sunlight
based beams diminished by 20\%, which gives
potential proficiency increments up to 20\%. These
are at present a wide range of varieties of
graphene-based sun based cells being explored
today. This guide gives a far reaching review into
the technique which is being examined and thereof
accomplishing a decent productivity.

Many infinite integrals involving the product of several Bessel functions
have been obtained. Choi and Agarwal have described two integrals involving the generalized Bessel function ${}_hJ_v$which is represented by Galue [1]. Using the same method,
in this paper, we present two generalized integral formulas involving the product of
generalized Bessel function of  ${}_hJ_v$, which are expressed in terms of the generalized
Lauricella series due to Srivastava and Daoust.Some interesting special cases of our
main results are also considered.

Incrementing interest in diesel engine technology and the perpetual ordinate dictation
of finding alternative sustainable fuels as well as reducing emissions has incentivized
over the years for the development of numerical models, to provide qualitatively
predictive implements for the designers. Among the alternative fuels, biodiesel
especially second generation biodiesel is considered as a sustainable and the most
promising option for the diesel engine.
Biodiesel is a bio-fuel which has kindred properties to diesel and can yarely be utilized
in a diesel engine with minimal modifications. Promising results have been determined
utilizing amalgamations of biodiesel and diesel with the reduction of soot and emissions
of a diesel engine. Experimental analysis of diesel engines can be sumptuous and ergo
Computation Fluid Dynamics programs are habituated to analyze the combustion
process. Present Study deals with the effect of Titanium oxide nano particle integration
to diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends by utilizing Computational Dynamics Method. In the
current study, we investigate that as we incremented the percentages of Bio-fuels and
Ethanol the efficiency of the coalesced fuel is incrementing and pollutant like Cox and
NOx are decrementing which shows solubility test as in an anterior work was stable.
In a compression-ignition engine, NOx emissions are one of the main pollutants and are
primarily influenced by the quantity of oxygen available and the temperature in the
cylinder.The NOx emission is composed of NO, NO2, N2O, N2O5, NO3. Nitric oxide is the
major constituent and NO2 is a minor constituent, while the others are negligible. At
elevated temperatures (i.e.) above 1500 C, N2 can react with O2 more expeditious and
may result in more NOx emission.Compression-ignition engines have an increased
compression ratio and are reduced-combustion engines, The peak temperature is well
over 1500C; therefore, there is an upper box formation.. In present work the evaluation
of the NOx (Prompt and Thermal) is withal carried out we investigate from CFD Results
that NOx percentages are decrementing with the integration of Tio2 (225 ppm) and
higher no. of BDE because as the temperature is getting higher the N-O bond will we
collapsed due to this Nitrogen is relinquished to the environment, hence NOx
percentage is decrementing from lower no. of BDE to the higher no. of BDE.

The effect of various combustible materials on insulating properties of refractory bricks
produced from Enugu fire clay and Ekebedi clay has been studied. This is aimed at determining the most
favourable combustible material for different composition(s).
\vskip 2mm
\newpage

The clays with combustible materials were
used to compose different samples labeled A-G with varying percentages of combustible materials at
reducing rate of 5\% from 40 to 10\%. The combustible materials used were paper pulp, saw dust, rice husk
and cow dung. Properly mixed bodies with required moisture content were hydraulically pressed into shape
and the bricks were oven-dried at temperature of ±110°C. The properties of the produced insulating bricks
were investigated after sintering at 1300°C. The results indicated that samples A-G of the products had \%
shrinkage ranging from 18 - 4.1\% with corresponding bulk density of 0.57- 1.29 g/cm3 respectively. The
investigation revealed that samples of the bricks as stated above had crushing strength ranging from 0.008-
16.05 MPa with corresponding percentage porosity ranging from 85.71-19.75\% respectively. The estimated
refractoriness using shuen’s formula revealed that samples A-G had 1004.6-1506.8°C range of
refractoriness while the result of the refractoriness using Pyrometric Cone Equivalent (PCE) indicated that
samples A-G had cone 05A (1010°C) - cone 19 (1520°C) range of refractoriness. Spalling count test result
revealed that samples A-G of bricks as stated above had number of cycles ranging from 31-8 respectively. It
was discovered that the higher the combustible materials the higher the shrinkage, porosity and spalling
count cycles while the lower the bulk density and crushing strength of the bricks. Samples of the insulating
bricks produced with rice husk gave the most favourable result when considered against the properties
stated above. Therefore, 30 and 25\% (samples C and D) of the rice husk can be used as combustible
material for mass production of insulating bricks.

In this experiment work we have taken multiple samples of different types of noisy
image like MRI, Cancer, X-ray, and Brain and we have calculated standard
derivations and mean of all these medical images after finding Gaussian noise and
then we have applied median filtering technique for removal of noise. After
removing a noise by using median filtering techniques again standard derivations
and mean are evaluated. This experimental analysis will improve the accuracy of the
MRI, Cancer, X-ray, and Brain images for easy diagnosis.
